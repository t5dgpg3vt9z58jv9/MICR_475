I wanted to investigate the popularity of the name "David" over time. 

**Library installation packages**
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("babynames",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library("babynames")
library(dplyr)
```

**Plot**
```{r}
my_data<- filter(babynames, name=="David",sex=="M")
   ggplot(data=my_data,aes(x = year, y = n)) +
   geom_line() + 
   labs(
        title = "Number of babies born as a male with the name David by Year", 
        x = "Year", 
        y = "Count")
```

**Conclusion**
I wanted to investigate the popularity of the name "David" over time. The name "David" appeared to peak in the late 1950's and early 1960's. It has declined into the 2000's.
