Homework 6 - Successful and Unsuccessful Plot Assignment
================

#### Successful Plot Analysis

The following figure was taken from a panel of figures. This figure
shows THP-1 cells that were exposed to varying concentrations of NECA
for 2 hours.

###### Plot Details

-   The data was mapped on a bar chart with error bars showing side by
    side comparison of each gene that was tested at different
    concentrations. Each gene was mapped to a different color.
-   The data set is continuous and multiple runs were averaged to create
    the bar chart. The difference of those runs is shown by the error
    bars.
-   The asterisks (\*) represent p values compared with untreated
    control.
    -   (\*) p&lt;0.05
    -   (\*\*) p&lt;0.01
    -   (\*\*\*) p&lt;0.001
-   3 NR4A genes were tested and were mapped to a color
    -   NRA4A1 is mapped to white
    -   NRA4A2 is mapped to grey
    -   NRA4A3 is mapped to black
-   3 concentrations of NECA were tested for each gene and plotted on
    the x-axis
    -   1 μM
    -   10 μM
    -   20 μM
-   The results are expressed as fold over untreated control(F.O.C) on
    the y-axis
    -   Error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM)
-   A constant time was used of 2 hours
-   A single type of cells was used (THP-1)

###### Plot Comments

-   This plot shows a lot of data but in a seemingly simple way without
    cluttering the figure.
-   The meaning of F.O.C was mentioned in the paper but not directly in
    the figure caption. F.O.C is not a standard abbreviation.
-   SEM was mentioned in the figure caption and is assumed to mean
    standard error of the mean.
-   The error bars were very small and did not overlap other data.

#### Unsuccessful Plot Analysis

The following figure shows the charge-hydropathy plot of NR A/B region.

###### Plot Details

-   The data was mapped as a scatter plot with a line representing a
    reference boundary.
-   The data set is continuous. It is unclear if each data point is an
    averaged set of data or if it maps to unique proteins.
-   Data in the plot
    -   Ordered Protein is in a blue color with a circle shape.
    -   Nuclear Receptors is in a red color with a diamond shape.
    -   Disordered Protein is in a brown color with a circle shape.
    -   The Average A/B value is in a yellow color and diamond shape.
    -   The Boundary is shown as a black line
-   The Mean Scaled Hydropathy is on the x-axis.
-   The Absolute Mean Net Charge is on the y-axis.

###### Plot Comments

-   The title in the plot caption and the plot legend does not match
    -   The caption says the plot is of “NR A/B region” meaning Nuclear
        Receptors A/B.
    -   The plot legend shows Nuclear Receptors as a red color but
        contains a lot more than just nuclear receptors.
-   The colors and shapes do not add value because they overlap.
    -   Both Ordered and Disordered Proteins are circles. Color is a
        requirement since the shapes are the same.
    -   Both Nuclear Receptors and the Average are diamonds. The Average
        diamond is larger so one can probably pick this out.  
-   The data used to create the plot is questionable.
    -   The legends describes a family of proteins. However, there are
        multiple items on the plot for each family. Based on previous
        knowledge, I do not think this plot contains a data point of
        every individual protein.
    -   Is each data point summarized or averaged? If so, what is the
        data behind each data point?
-   The Average value shown in the plot does not make sense
    -   Does the average value represent an average of ordered
        receptors, nuclear receptors, and disordered proteins?
    -   The plot caption says it represents the average A/B value but it
        this of the nuclear receptors A/B only? Is it the A/B region of
        other proteins?
    -   It is not clear how the average value helps me understand the
        plot given the variability of the data.
-   The Boundary line is from data of data sets for a reference
    boundary.
    -   How were these data sets chosen as a reference? It is not clear
        that the data point on the scatter plot are part of the boundary
        line and that the boundary line could be a different set of
        data.

###### Plot Improvments

-   This plot is complicated to understand. I think it’s hard to try to
    plot families of diverse proteins on a single figure.
-   This plot could be a victim of design vs data variation as described
    by Tufte.
-   Wilke would likely introduce different sizes of shapes and/or colors
    to improve the existing plot
-   The plot would be improved by narrowing down the scope of the plot.
    -   Can we look at individual nuclear receptors against a family of
        nuclear receptors?
    -   What is gained by comparing nuclear receptors A/B region against
        other non-related proteins? The A/B region is a small part of a
        nuclear receptor and is not the entire protein.
    -   The boundary line might be able to be removed. The average value
        might also be able to be removed.
