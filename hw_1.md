**Homework 1**
================

I am writing this homework for **MICR 575**. This class meets on
*Monday-Wednesday-Friday*. R markdown does not include a code for <span
style="text-decoration:underline">underlined text</span> but can be done
using CSS for HTML output.

The following is a calculation in **R**.

``` r
2+2
```

    ## [1] 4
